		    	<div class='text'>My second summer interning at API we were having issues keeping filter lenses parallel to their carrier plate. The previous tooling used a clamp to apply pressure to the filter and prevent glue wicking underneath it, but the force applied caused warpage of the filter or tungsten carbide plate. I used a brass lid for the tooling to weigh down the filters, preventing wicking and warping, and maintaining the micron parallelism of the filters to the plate</div>

				<div class='text'>This is the tooling base that accepted the lid described above. The tooling included finger holes for picking up the finished part. Making it look like a Mario face block was just fun to do</div>

				<div class='text'>A rendering of the furnace basket described on the right. Because the basket was nearly 12 feet long and over 7 feet tall, it was prohibitively expensive to build and test a prototype. I designed the basket in Inventor, then used the built in simulation tools to ensure the basket would survive several ton loads and temperatures exceeding 1000F</div>

I used walnut for the legs because I wanted to emulate the black steel of the coffee table, but soften it for the bedroom. The shelf and table top are a box made from redwood fence posts. Mainly because they are cheap and often beautifully figured plainsawn boards</div>

				<div class='text'>My first project at my first internship was to redesign the underperforming microscope heating chamber. The recirculating system put excessive strain on the small fan, which couldn't push enough air to provide the heat needed. My first fix was a plenum on the return side which stabilized air into the heater and restored expected performance. This wasn't the final design we went with, but it was an important step in discovering the ultimate solution</div>

			<div class='flavor'>
				<div class='text'>After a hose fell off while running a test with the design above, performance skyrocketed. Chasing that performance I ended up eliminating the recirculating system, and filtered the incoming air instead. This filter box held the selected filter, and attached to the heater with magnets so it could be easily removed and sanitized in laboratory use</div>

Previously I created and hosted my personal website using various website building services, but I decided to explore doing it on my own. I poured over W3 schools, stack exchange, and many blogs to learn enough to make it happen. I use this as a way to explore the languages, and display my work and hobbies.
